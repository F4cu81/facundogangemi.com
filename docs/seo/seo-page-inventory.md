---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This inventory documents the current SEO configuration of every page on `facundogangemi.com` as of Phase 4 implementation (Phase 4a through Phase 4d).

**What this document is:**
- A reference snapshot of each page's SEO state: title, description, canonical URL, H1, search intent, structured data and indexability.
- A coordination tool to prevent duplicate titles, duplicate meta descriptions and conflicting search intent across pages.
- A change log anchor — update this file whenever a page is added, deleted or significantly changed.

**What this document is not:**
- It does not control runtime behaviour. Metadata is defined in page `.astro` files and `src/data/site.ts`.
- It does not replace `docs/seo/google-positioning-guardrails.md` (SEO strategy) or `docs/seo/article-seo-guidelines.md` (article-level rules).

**Update triggers:**
- A new page is added or removed.
- A page title, meta description, canonical URL, H1 or search intent changes.
- Structured data is added, modified or removed from any page.
- A placeholder page is promoted to a full strategic landing page.

## 4. Placeholder Pages

The following pages were created during Phase 4a as structural placeholders. Each has real copy and correct metadata but does not yet have full strategic content depth.

| Route | Purpose | Future role | Primary keyword | Expand to full page? | Recommended expansion |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ~~`/advisory/`~~ | ~~Hub entry point~~ | **Complete — Phase 7** | — | — | Single-page hub with four anchor-section practices (AI Strategy, Digital Transformation, Operational Excellence, AI Adoption). Full hero, practice sections with focus area cards, final CTA. |

## 5. Insights and Article SEO Readiness

### Current state

The Insights section has four active category hub pages and one main index page, all structurally complete:

| Hub route | `categorySlug` | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/insights/` | — | Insights \| AI Strategy & Transformation | Phase 10D/10E — full editorial hub; 1 article published |
| `/insights/ai-strategy/` | `ai-strategy` | AI Strategy Insights | Active hub — 1 article published |
| `/insights/digital-transformation/` | `digital-transformation` | Digital Transformation Insights | Active hub — no articles yet |
| `/insights/operational-excellence/` | `operational-excellence` | Operational Excellence Insights | Active hub — no articles yet |
| `/insights/ai-adoption/` | `ai-adoption` | AI Adoption Insights | Active hub — added Phase 10 (2026-05-14) |
| `/insights/strategy-execution/` | ~~`strategy-execution`~~ | Strategy Execution Insights | **Deprecated and never built** — planned hub superseded by AI Adoption before implementation; no file on disk |

**Individual articles:** 1 article published — `/insights/ai-strategy/ai-strategy-operating-model/` (Phase 10D, 2026-05-14). The article template (`src/pages/insights/[...slug].astro`) is production-ready and validated end-to-end.

### Article template — Phase 10C/10E production readiness summary

Phase 10C hardened the article template. Phase 10E added layout upgrades and SEO improvements. The following is confirmed implemented in `src/pages/insights/[...slug].astro` and `src/content/config.ts`:

| Area | Status | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| Content schema | ✅ Complete | `updatedDate: z.coerce.date().optional()`, `image`, `imageAlt`, `author`, `language` fields in schema |
| Article JSON-LD | ✅ Complete | `headline`, `description`, `datePublished`, `dateModified`, `author`, `publisher`, `mainEntityOfPage`, `image` (conditional), `timeRequired`, `articleSection` (from `category`), `keywords` (from title, category, tags) |
| BreadcrumbList JSON-LD | ✅ Complete | 4-item breadcrumb: Home → Insights → Category hub → Article (Phase 10E SEO fix) |
| Hero image | ✅ Complete | `width="1200"` `height="630"`, `loading="eager"`, `alt` falls back to `title` |
| Article body layout | ✅ Complete | 3-column desktop grid (240px TOC, 1fr body, 300px sidebar) at ≥1280px; single-column below |
| Sticky TOC | ✅ Complete | Build-time H2 extraction, `position: sticky`, mobile `<details>` disclosure |
| Latest Insights sidebar | ✅ Complete | Up to 3 related articles; column always reserved; heading always visible |
| Article image support | ✅ Complete | Hero image from `image` frontmatter; used as OG image |
| Category-aware CTA | ✅ Complete | Footer CTA derives label and URL from `categorySlug`; fallback to `/contact/` |
| Reading time | ✅ Complete | Computed at build time from `article.body` at 220 wpm; displayed in meta row; `timeRequired` in JSON-LD |
| Nested slug routing | ✅ Complete | Template renamed to `[...slug].astro` to support slugs containing `/` (e.g. `ai-strategy/ai-strategy-operating-model`) |
| CTA trailing slash | ✅ Complete | All footer CTAs use trailing slash |

### Article SEO requirements

All articles published to `/insights/` must follow `docs/seo/article-seo-guidelines.md` before publication. Key requirements:

- Assign to one of the **four production categories**: `ai-strategy`, `digital-transformation`, `operational-excellence`, `ai-adoption`.
- Article `title` in frontmatter should stay ≤42 chars — BaseLayout appends ` | Facundo Gangemi` (18 chars), keeping the full `<title>` within the 60-char SEO target.
- Meta description 120–155 chars.
- Primary keyphrase in title, H1, and first 100 words.
- Article JSON-LD is template-generated — author does not need to write schema manually.
- Hero images should be 1200×630 px where possible to match the `width`/`height` hint in the template.
- Internal links: at minimum one link to the relevant advisory page and one back to the category hub.
- Pre-publish checklist in `docs/seo/article-seo-guidelines.md` must be completed before any article goes live.

### Article JSON-LD validation status

Article JSON-LD (`Article` schema) is implemented and builds without errors. The structured data output must be confirmed with Google's Rich Results Test after deployment. OG image, Twitter card and social preview should be confirmed with LinkedIn Post Inspector and Twitter Card Validator after first public deployment.

## 6. Structured Data Inventory

### Currently implemented

| Schema type | Where | Key fields |
|---|---|---|
| `Person` | All pages (via BaseLayout) | `name`, `url`, `jobTitle`, `description`, `sameAs` (LinkedIn) |
| `WebSite` | Homepage only (via `structuredData` prop) | `name`, `url`, `description` |
| `ProfessionalService` | Homepage only (via `structuredData` prop) | `name`, `url`, `description`, `areaServed`, `serviceType` (4 values — updated Phase 7: AI Strategy Advisory, Digital Transformation Advisory, Operational Excellence Advisory, AI Adoption Advisory) |
| `Service` | `/advisory/` (via `structuredData` prop) | `name`, `provider` (Person), `description`, `url`, `serviceType` (4 values), `areaServed` |
| `ContactPage` | `/contact/` (page-level) | `name`, `description`, `url`, `author` |
| `CollectionPage` | `/insights/` (page-level) | `name`, `description`, `url`, `author` |
| `Article` | Each `/insights/[...slug]/` article | `headline`, `description`, `datePublished`, `dateModified`, `author`, `publisher`, `mainEntityOfPage`, `image` (conditional), `timeRequired` (ISO 8601, computed at build time), `articleSection` (from `category`), `keywords` (title + category + tags) |
| `BreadcrumbList` | Each `/insights/[...slug]/` article | 4 items: Home → Insights → Category hub → Article canonical URL (Phase 10E SEO fix) |

### Not yet implemented

| Schema type | Recommended for | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `BreadcrumbList` | Interior advisory pages | Only implemented on article pages currently. Advisory pages do not yet have breadcrumb structured data. |
| `FAQPage` | Advisory or assessment pages only if real FAQ content exists | Do not add unless genuine Q&A content is written. Never invent FAQ entries for SEO purposes alone. |

## 7. Internal Linking Notes

### Main navigation

| Nav item | Route | Dropdown children |
|---|---|---|
| Advisory | `/advisory` | AI Strategy (`/advisory/#ai-strategy`), Digital Transformation (`/advisory/#digital-transformation`), Operational Excellence (`/advisory/#operational-excellence`), AI Adoption (`/advisory/#ai-adoption`) |
| Case Studies | `/case-studies` | — |
| Insights | `/insights` | — |
| About | `/about` | — |
| CTA: Book Advisory Call | `/contact` | — |

### Footer navigation

| Column | Links |
|---|---|
| Advisory | AI Strategy Advisory (`/advisory/#ai-strategy`), Digital Transformation (`/advisory/#digital-transformation`), Operational Excellence (`/advisory/#operational-excellence`), AI Adoption & Enablement (`/advisory/#ai-adoption`), Executive Advisory Hub (`/advisory/`) |
| Resources | Insights, Case Studies, Speaking, AI Assessment, Newsletter |
| About | About Facundo, Contact |
| Legal (bottom) | Legal Notice, Privacy Policy, Cookie Policy, Terms & Conditions |

### Advisory page cross-links (current)

| Page | Links to |
|---|---|
| `/advisory/` | `/advisory/#ai-strategy` (anchor), `/advisory/#digital-transformation` (anchor), `/advisory/#operational-excellence` (anchor), `/advisory/#ai-adoption` (anchor), `/contact/`, `/insights/` |

Note: All advisory sub-pages (`/advisory/ai-strategy/`, `/advisory/digital-transformation/`, `/advisory/ai-adoption/`, `/advisory/enterprise-agility/`) were deleted in Phase 8 (2026-05-13). `/advisory/` is the only advisory route. All internal links and navigation use anchor-based URLs.

### Required cross-links not yet present

Per `docs/seo/google-positioning-guardrails.md` (Section 10), the following required links are not yet in place:

| Source page | Missing link |
|---|---|
| `/advisory/` | → `/insights/ai-strategy/` (add once articles exist — currently links to `/insights/` hub) |
| `/advisory/` | → `/about/` (consider adding to final CTA or hero sub-copy) |
| `/insights/` | → relevant advisory page sections (links should be within article cards or intro copy) |
| Each insight article | → relevant advisory page anchor, related insight category |

### Home page internal links added — Phase 8

The Phase 8 Home Authority & Proof Layer introduced two new editorial CTA links from the Homepage:

| Source section | Link destination | Link label | Added |
|---|---|---|---|
| Signature Framework | `/advisory/` | Explore Advisory Practices | Phase 8 (2026-05-13) |
| About Snapshot | `/about/` | Explore my background | Phase 8 (2026-05-13) |

Both links are text-link CTAs (`sf-cta-link` pattern), not primary buttons. They strengthen the Home → Advisory and Home → About internal link signals, which previously existed only through navigation or the Final CTA.

### Internal linking risks

- `/es/` has no internal links to English advisory pages. If kept indexed, it is an orphan for cross-language navigation.
- `/newsletter/` links to `/insights` but has no back-link from `/insights` to `/newsletter`. Consider adding a subscribe CTA to the Insights index.

## 8. Known Remaining Recommendations

These are non-blocking improvements identified during Phase 4. None are urgent but all should be addressed before major public promotion of the site.

| Priority | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ~~High~~ | ~~Fix `/advisory/` meta description (165 chars)~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — now 151 chars. |
| ~~High~~ | ~~Fix `/contact/` meta description (156 chars)~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — now 153 chars. |
| ~~High~~ | ~~Fix `/speaking/` meta description (157 chars)~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — now 146 chars. |
| ~~High~~ | ~~Expand `/insights/digital-transformation/` meta description (108 chars)~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — now 153 chars. |
| ~~High~~ | ~~Fix `/about/` H1 — does not include a primary keyphrase~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — H1 is now `Facundo Gangemi — AI Strategy & Digital Transformation Advisor`. |
| ~~Medium~~ | ~~Consider `noIndex` on `/es/` until Spanish content is ready~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — `noIndex={true}` added; hreflang structure preserved. Remove when Spanish content is ready. |
| ~~High~~ | ~~Set `noIndex={true}` on `/advisory/enterprise-agility/`~~ | **Fixed Phase 7** — `noIndex={true}` applied. |
| ~~Medium~~ | ~~Decide fate of orphaned advisory sub-pages (`/advisory/ai-strategy/`, `/advisory/digital-transformation/`, `/advisory/ai-adoption/`)~~ | **Resolved Phase 8 (2026-05-13)** — all sub-pages deleted. `/advisory/` is the single advisory hub. |
| ~~Medium~~ | ~~Expand placeholder advisory pages into full strategic landing pages~~ | **Superseded Phase 8** — advisory sub-pages deleted; all practices consolidated under `/advisory/` with anchor sections. |
| Medium | Validate article JSON-LD with Google Rich Results Test on first article publish | Article schema not yet confirmed end-to-end. |
| Medium | Validate OG / social card previews with LinkedIn Post Inspector, Facebook Sharing Debugger and Twitter Card Validator after deployment | WebP generated — confirm actual social preview rendering. |
| Medium | Add `og:locale:alternate` for `es_ES` on the homepage | Minor signal improvement for international SEO. |
| Low | Consider adding `email` to Person JSON-LD on homepage | Only if intentionally public-facing — check preference before implementing. |
| Low | Consider `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD on advisory and insights pages | Useful once pages have full content and depth. |
| Low | Add subscribe CTA on `/insights/` linking to `/newsletter/` | Improves cross-link between content hub and newsletter. |
| Low | Consider `SearchAction` in WebSite schema | Only if site search is ever implemented. |
| Low | Add speaking engagements to `/speaking/` once real events exist | Do not invent past engagements. |

## 9. Maintenance Rules

These rules apply to all future changes to pages, routes, metadata and content:

1. **Update this inventory** whenever a page is added, deleted or significantly changed in title, description, H1, canonical URL, search intent or structured data.

2. **No duplicate SEO titles.** Every strategic page must have a unique `<title>`. If a title is already used by another page, change one before publishing.

3. **No duplicate meta descriptions.** Every strategic page must have a unique `<meta name="description">`. Run a duplicate check in this inventory before adding or changing descriptions.

4. **Every strategic page must have one clear primary search intent.** Do not try to optimise a single page for more than one primary intent.

5. **Meta descriptions must be 120–155 characters.** Check length before publishing. Update this inventory with the confirmed character count.

6. **Placeholder pages must be replaced with full content before major public promotion** — including before social advertising, email campaigns or PR that would drive significant traffic.

7. **Legal pages must be reviewed by a qualified legal professional** before being treated as final. The current legal pages are working drafts.

8. **All new articles must complete the pre-publish checklist** defined in `docs/seo/article-seo-guidelines.md` before going live.

9. **Do not add structured data that claims unsupported facts** — no invented client names, fake testimonials, unverified metrics, credentials not held.

10. **Confirm internal links point to existing routes** before publishing any new page. Do not link to pages that return 404.
