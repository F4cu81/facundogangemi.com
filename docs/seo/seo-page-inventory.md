# SEO Page Inventory
## facundogangemi.com — Post Phase 4 Implementation

---

## 1. Purpose of This Document

This inventory documents the current SEO configuration of every page on `facundogangemi.com` as of Phase 4 implementation (Phase 4a through Phase 4d).

**What this document is:**
- A reference snapshot of each page's SEO state: title, description, canonical URL, H1, search intent, structured data and indexability.
- A coordination tool to prevent duplicate titles, duplicate meta descriptions and conflicting search intent across pages.
- A change log anchor — update this file whenever a page is added, deleted or significantly changed.

**What this document is not:**
- It does not control runtime behaviour. Metadata is defined in page `.astro` files and `src/data/site.ts`.
- It does not replace `docs/seo/google-positioning-guardrails.md` (SEO strategy) or `docs/seo/article-seo-guidelines.md` (article-level rules).

**Update triggers:**
- A new page is added or removed.
- A page title, meta description, canonical URL, H1 or search intent changes.
- Structured data is added, modified or removed from any page.
- A placeholder page is promoted to a full strategic landing page.

### Advisory sub-pages — Deleted (2026-05-13)

The following advisory sub-pages were deleted as part of the Phase 8 advisory architecture consolidation. The decision was made to keep `/advisory/` as the single canonical advisory hub with anchor-based sections, rather than maintaining orphaned or thin sub-pages on disk.

| Route | Former status | Reason for deletion |
|---|---|---|
| `/advisory/ai-strategy/` | Orphaned since Phase 7 (unlinked from nav/footer) | Removed — practice now covered by `/advisory/#ai-strategy` |
| `/advisory/digital-transformation/` | Orphaned since Phase 7 (unlinked from nav/footer) | Removed — practice now covered by `/advisory/#digital-transformation` |
| `/advisory/enterprise-agility/` | Deprecated since Phase 7 (`noIndex={true}` applied) | Removed — practice replaced by `Operational Excellence` at `/advisory/#operational-excellence` |
| `/advisory/ai-adoption/` | Orphaned since Phase 7 (unlinked from nav/footer) | Removed — practice now covered by `/advisory/#ai-adoption` |

All four practices remain fully accessible through `/advisory/` anchor sections. No redirects were added (site is in development; no existing redirect mechanism configured).

## 5. Insights and Article SEO Readiness

### Current state

The Insights section has four category hub pages and one main index page, all structurally complete:

| Hub route | Title | Status |
|---|---|---|
| `/insights/` | Insights \| AI Strategy & Transformation | Phase 6a — full editorial hub; no articles yet |
| `/insights/ai-strategy/` | AI Strategy Insights | Active hub — no articles yet |
| `/insights/digital-transformation/` | Digital Transformation Insights | Active hub — no articles yet |
| `/insights/operational-excellence/` | Operational Excellence Insights | Active hub — no articles yet |
| `/insights/strategy-execution/` | Strategy Execution Insights | Active hub — no articles yet |

**Individual articles:** None published yet. The article template (`src/pages/insights/[slug].astro`) is implemented and ready.

### Article SEO requirements

All articles published to `/insights/` must follow `docs/seo/article-seo-guidelines.md` before publication. Key requirements:

- Assign to one of the eight defined content hubs.
- Title under 60 chars including ` | Facundo Gangemi` suffix.
- Meta description 120–155 chars.
- Primary keyphrase in title, H1, and first 100 words.
- Article JSON-LD (`Article` or `BlogPosting` schema) — not yet validated end-to-end.
- Internal links: at minimum one link to the relevant advisory page and one back to the category hub.
- Pre-publish checklist in `docs/seo/article-seo-guidelines.md` must be completed before any article goes live.

### Article JSON-LD validation status

Article JSON-LD (`Article` schema) has **not yet been validated end-to-end** because no articles have been published. The `[slug].astro` template exists but its structured data output must be confirmed with Google's Rich Results Test tool when the first article is published.

### Recommended first article

Publish one substantive article (800+ words) in the **AI Strategy** hub (`/insights/ai-strategy/`) to validate:

1. The full article template renders correctly.
2. Article JSON-LD (`Article` schema) is valid in Google Rich Results Test.
3. The category hub (`/insights/ai-strategy/`) correctly lists the article.
4. Internal links between article → hub → advisory page work as expected.
5. OG image, Twitter card and social preview work as expected.

Suggested topic: `"Why Most AI Strategies Fail Before Execution"` — targets a known executive search intent, aligns with the AI Strategy hub, and connects naturally to `/advisory/#ai-strategy`.

### Advisory page cross-links (current)

| Page | Links to |
|---|---|
| `/advisory/` | `/advisory/#ai-strategy` (anchor), `/advisory/#digital-transformation` (anchor), `/advisory/#operational-excellence` (anchor), `/advisory/#ai-adoption` (anchor), `/contact/`, `/insights/` |

Note: All advisory sub-pages (`/advisory/ai-strategy/`, `/advisory/digital-transformation/`, `/advisory/ai-adoption/`, `/advisory/enterprise-agility/`) were deleted in Phase 8 (2026-05-13). `/advisory/` is the only advisory route. All internal links and navigation use anchor-based URLs.

### Required cross-links not yet present

Per `docs/seo/google-positioning-guardrails.md` (Section 10), the following required links are not yet in place:

| Source page | Missing link |
|---|---|
| `/advisory/` | → `/insights/ai-strategy/` (add once articles exist — currently links to `/insights/` hub) |
| `/advisory/` | → `/about/` (consider adding to final CTA or hero sub-copy) |
| `/insights/` | → relevant advisory page sections (links should be within article cards or intro copy) |
| Each insight article | → relevant advisory page anchor, related insight category |
| `/about/` | → `/speaking/` (currently not linked) |

### Internal linking risks

- `/es/` has no internal links to English advisory pages. If kept indexed, it is an orphan for cross-language navigation.
- `/newsletter/` links to `/insights` but has no back-link from `/insights` to `/newsletter`. Consider adding a subscribe CTA to the Insights index.

## 8. Known Remaining Recommendations

These are non-blocking improvements identified during Phase 4. None are urgent but all should be addressed before major public promotion of the site.

| Priority | Item | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| ~~High~~ | ~~Fix `/advisory/` meta description (165 chars)~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — now 151 chars. |
| ~~High~~ | ~~Fix `/contact/` meta description (156 chars)~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — now 153 chars. |
| ~~High~~ | ~~Fix `/speaking/` meta description (157 chars)~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — now 146 chars. |
| ~~High~~ | ~~Expand `/insights/digital-transformation/` meta description (108 chars)~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — now 153 chars. |
| ~~High~~ | ~~Fix `/about/` H1 — does not include a primary keyphrase~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — H1 is now `Facundo Gangemi — AI Strategy & Digital Transformation Advisor`. |
| ~~Medium~~ | ~~Consider `noIndex` on `/es/` until Spanish content is ready~~ | **Fixed Phase 4d** — `noIndex={true}` added; hreflang structure preserved. Remove when Spanish content is ready. |
| ~~High~~ | ~~Set `noIndex={true}` on `/advisory/enterprise-agility/`~~ | **Fixed Phase 7** — `noIndex={true}` applied. |
| ~~Medium~~ | ~~Decide fate of orphaned advisory sub-pages (`/advisory/ai-strategy/`, `/advisory/digital-transformation/`, `/advisory/ai-adoption/`)~~ | **Resolved Phase 8 (2026-05-13)** — all sub-pages deleted. `/advisory/` is the single advisory hub. |
| ~~Medium~~ | ~~Expand placeholder advisory pages into full strategic landing pages~~ | **Superseded Phase 8** — advisory sub-pages deleted; all practices consolidated under `/advisory/` with anchor sections. |
| Medium | Validate article JSON-LD with Google Rich Results Test on first article publish | Article schema not yet confirmed end-to-end. |
| Medium | Validate OG / social card previews with LinkedIn Post Inspector, Facebook Sharing Debugger and Twitter Card Validator after deployment | WebP generated — confirm actual social preview rendering. |
| Medium | Add `og:locale:alternate` for `es_ES` on the homepage | Minor signal improvement for international SEO. |
| Low | Consider adding `email` to Person JSON-LD on homepage | Only if intentionally public-facing — check preference before implementing. |
| Low | Consider `BreadcrumbList` JSON-LD on advisory and insights pages | Useful once pages have full content and depth. |
| Low | Add subscribe CTA on `/insights/` linking to `/newsletter/` | Improves cross-link between content hub and newsletter. |
| Low | Consider `SearchAction` in WebSite schema | Only if site search is ever implemented. |
| Low | Add speaking engagements to `/speaking/` once real events exist | Do not invent past engagements. |

## 9. Maintenance Rules

These rules apply to all future changes to pages, routes, metadata and content:

1. **Update this inventory** whenever a page is added, deleted or significantly changed in title, description, H1, canonical URL, search intent or structured data.

2. **No duplicate SEO titles.** Every strategic page must have a unique `<title>`. If a title is already used by another page, change one before publishing.

3. **No duplicate meta descriptions.** Every strategic page must have a unique `<meta name="description">`. Run a duplicate check in this inventory before adding or changing descriptions.

4. **Every strategic page must have one clear primary search intent.** Do not try to optimise a single page for more than one primary intent.

5. **Meta descriptions must be 120–155 characters.** Check length before publishing. Update this inventory with the confirmed character count.

6. **Placeholder pages must be replaced with full content before major public promotion** — including before social advertising, email campaigns or PR that would drive significant traffic.

7. **Legal pages must be reviewed by a qualified legal professional** before being treated as final. The current legal pages are working drafts.

8. **All new articles must complete the pre-publish checklist** defined in `docs/seo/article-seo-guidelines.md` before going live.

9. **Do not add structured data that claims unsupported facts** — no invented client names, fake testimonials, unverified metrics, credentials not held.

10. **Confirm internal links point to existing routes** before publishing any new page. Do not link to pages that return 404.
